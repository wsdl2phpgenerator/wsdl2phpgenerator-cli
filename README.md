Command line application wrapper for the [wsdl2phpgenerator](https://github.com/wsdl2phpgenerator/wsdl2phpgenerator) library. Takes a WSDL file and outputs PHP class files ready to use.

Uses the [MIT licence](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php).

## Maintenance status

This is no longer actively maintained.

If you are looking for a PHP library to work with SOAP, you might want to try [`phpro/soap-client`](https://github.com/phpro/soap-client).

If you are currently using `wsdl2phpgenerator` and want to continue using it, consider forking the project and maintain it yourself.

## Usage

Getting a cli version of wsdl2phpgenerator 3 is a work in progress.

To use the last version of wsdl2phpgenerator 2 follow these steps:

1. Download [wsdl2phpgenerator-2.5.5.phar](https://github.com/wsdl2phpgenerator/wsdl2phpgenerator/releases/download/2.5.5/wsdl2phpgenerator-2.5.5.phar)
1. Run `php wsdl2phpgenerator-2.5.5.phar -i input.wsdl -o tmp/my/directory/wsdl`

The directory is created if possible.


## Versioning

This project mirrors [the versioning of the wsdl2phpgenerator library](https://github.com/wsdl2phpgenerator/wsdl2phpgenerator#versioning). A new release of the library will incur a new release of the CLI app with a similar name.
